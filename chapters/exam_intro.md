# Our Exams

Our exams will be posted here.

There are a few for the exams. First, **you may not work with anyone else, share code, etc.**. That's an absolute rule. Second, if you Google some code, give attribution. In fact, you can use Markdown to provide a link to where you got your code! Third, your exam should be a Jupyter notebook that I can run from start to finish on my end. Make your code and output easy to read.
