# Our Exams

You can find our two exams here. The midterm is due Sunday at midnight, but was not written to take that long.

There are two rules for the exams. First, **you may not work with anyone else, share code, etc.**. That's an absolute rule. Second, if you Google some code, give attribution. In fact, you can use Markdown to provide a link to where you got your code!
