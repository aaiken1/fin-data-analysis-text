# Markdown

Markdown is a *light weight*, HTML-like language that lets us format text. This means that you won't, for example, highlight a word and find the **bold** button in a menu bar. Instead, you will use the Markdown notation to indicate what formatting you would like.

I suggest starting at [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook) for some examples of how to use Markdown in a Jupyter notebook. We'll go through our own examples in class.
