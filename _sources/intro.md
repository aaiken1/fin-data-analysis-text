```{note}
This is a living textbook. I will be updating the notes and making improvements as we go.
```

Welcome! This online text contains my notes and code examples. There are essentially three parts to this course. First, we'll get set-up and become comfortable with our coding environment.

We also have a course [Github repository](https://github.com/aaiken1/fin-data-analysis-python), where I will keep data and code (e.g. Jupyter notebooks) that we use in class.

We also have a course [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo4Q9ijN3eTG6t2-Lwzf7KlOooypFQak8), where I will post the occasional video, as needed. Most of our work will of course be done in class together.

The most important part is to make sure that you are up and running with Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, and VS Code. We'll discuss how to get started in [Chapter 2](chapters/2_intro.html#python_set-up).

```{hint}
Bookmark important links so that you don't have to go searching for them.

## Sources

I have pulled material from many different sources in order to create these notes and I am very grateful that they have made their work available. For example, I include commentary on examples from our book. There are also many other excellent and, often, free guides to using Python, Jupyter notebooks, and VS Code.

[The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). This is the main tutorial from the folks who develop Python. I'll refer to it throughout the text if you want a more in-depth look at something.

[Python for Finance, 2e](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-finance/9781492024323/). This is probably the best single book for finance and Python that I've found. However, it does jump from the basics into more advanced material quite quickly. This textbook also has a Github repository that [contains the code used in the book](https://github.com/yhilpisch/py4fi2nd).

There are also many free resources available. The key is being able to find what's helpful - web searches often lead you to awful AI-generated Medium posts. While these guides are not finance-related, *per se*, they cover material that will come up in any sort of data science project. I thank the authors for making these resources available and I use examples from them in my notes.

[Coding for Economists](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/intro.html) is an excellent online book that discusses getting Python set up, importing and exploring your data, as well as more advanced econometrics topics that we won't get into here. But, if you're using STATA in another class, I recommend taking a look at what you can do for free in Python. You might not have that STATA license on the job! He even tells you how to automate your VS Code set-up, if you're into that kind of thing.

[Python Programming for Data Science](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/README.html) is another great, general resource. You'll find a discussion of the basics, along with a Python style guide for writing readable code, details and about NumPy and Pandas, and tips for data wrangling and cleaning.

[Python for Data Analysis, 3E](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) is also available for free online. The author has just updated to a third edition.

If interested, I have set-up **optional** [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) courses that you can complete throughout the semester. See our Moodle page for the log in instructions - I have already set up our class page on DataCamp. If you completed all of the assignments, you'll have earned two different certificates. DataCamp also has lots of mini-tutorials and **cheatsheets** that can help get you started.

I also have a collection of non-DataCamp cheat sheets. 

- [Comprehensive Python Cheatsheet](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/)

I have also found the [The Self-Taught Programmer](https://www.theselftaughtprogrammer.io) a useful book, especially for someone like me, who does write code for research, but has only had a few formal computer science courses.

## Getting help

```{note}
No programming background is required for this class. For both students and instructor.
```

Learning to code means learning how to get help. No one has all of this stuff in their head at all times. That means using our textbook, the online books above, cheatsheets, and other resources. The links posted above will help a lot.

You can find help on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), though "copy and paste" isn't really the best way to learn to code. Go slowly, line-by-line, and try to think like a computer. They do exactly what you tell them to do. No more, no less.

I want to use the Discord server to discuss our weekly labs and projects. If you have a question, I'm sure others do as well! Ask your classmates for help there and I can follow along and add my two-cents. Just don't post all of your code - the only way to learn is **by doing**.
