# Using Github and Github Codespaces

We will go through how to get set-up in class. This means signing-up for a Github account, accessing assignments (i.e. forking repositories) via Github Classroom, working on these assignments in **Github Codespaces**, and then, finally, submitting your assignments back to Github Classroom using **git commands**. 

Here are the basic steps.

1. Sign-up for a Github Account: <https://github.com/signup>. Use your **Elon email address**. 

```{figure} ../images/22-github-page.png
---
name: 22-github-page.png
align: center
---
Your main Github page with your repositories.
```

2. Go to **Moodle** and find the **link for Lab00**. This is the lab to help us get started. You'll be asked to find your name from the class roster and then link your Github account to our Github Classroom. Github Classroom is how you will access and submit assignments. 
   
When you access an assignment, you'll **fork** (copy) the **repository** (folder) with that assignment. You'll then work in this new repository, which will be part of your Github account. For example, you'll have a new repository names something like **lab00-getting-started-git-aaiken1student**, where you're Github username will replace my name. 

```{figure} ../images/22-githubclassroom-verify.png
---
name: 22-githubclassroom-verify.png
align: center
---
Link my Github Classroom to your Github account.
```

This repository will have the assignment file and anything else that you might need.

Since this repository is part of Github Classroom, I'll be able to see your code as you work. No need to email files back and forth like an animal!
