# Using Github and Github Codespaces

We will go through how to get set-up in class. This means signing-up for a Github account, accessing assignments (i.e. forking repositories) via Github Classroom, working on these assignments in **Github Codespaces**, and then, finally, submitting your assignments back to Github Classroom using **git commands**. 

Here are the basic steps.

- Sign-up for a Github Account: <https://github.com/signup>. Use your **Elon email address**. 

```{figure} ../images/22-github-page.png

name: 22-github-page.png

Your main Github page with your repositories.
```

- Go to **Moodle** and find the **link for Lab00**. This is the lab to help us get started. You'll be asked to find your name from the class roster and then link your Github account to our Github Classroom. Github Classroom is how you will access and submit assignments and is called ** elon-fin-data**. 
   
When you **accept** an assignment, you'll **fork** (copy) the **repository** (folder) with that assignment. You'll then work in this new repository, which will be linked to your Github account. For example, you'll see a new repository named something like **lab00-getting-started-git-aaiken1student**, where you're Github username will replace my name. 

```{figure} ../images/22-roster.png

name: 22-roster.png

---
You'll see a list of everyone in the class when you first access an assignment. You'll need to link your Github account to the username in Github Classroom.
```

```{figure} ../images/22-githubclassroom-verify.png
---
name: 22-githubclassroom-verify.png
align: center
---
Link my Github Classroom to your Github account.
```

This repository will have the assignment file and anything else that you might need. Note that you may have to refresh your browser in order to finally accept the assignment.


```{figure} ../images/22-accept-assignment.png
---
name: 22-accept-assignment.png
align: center
---
You'll accept the assignment to fork the repository.
```

Since this repository is part of Github Classroom, I'll be able to see your code as you work. No need to email files back and forth like an animal!

```{figure} ../images/22-accepted.png
---
name: 22-accepted.png
align: center
---
You'll need to refresh your browser to complete the process.
```

```{figure} ../images/22-ready.png
---
name: 22-ready.png
align: center
---
Ready to go after a browser refresh. You see the URL for the new repository that you've created using the assignment. 
```

- Now that you've accepted the assignment, it is time to get to work! **Browse to your assignment repo.** 

I have created a Youtube video that shows you some of the basics of how a repo works: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOevORafn-g>.
  
This assignment repo is your own, personal copy of the assignment. All of your work for that particular assignment is going to be stored in that folder on Github. But, I might go and update the assignment! What happens to your copy? You can **synch fork** to make sure that you have latest assignment. There will be a message at the top of the repo if you are out of synch. 
  

```{figure} ../images/22-assignment-repo.png
---
name: 22-assignment-repo.png
align: center
---
You can open up a Github Codespace from the assignment repo.
```

Now, you can open up a **Github Codespace**. Codespace is essentially VS Code, but in the cloud, running on Github (i.e. Microsoft) servers. You get a certain number of hours of runtime for free each month. It should be more than enough for the work that we're doing in this class.

I have also created a video that shows you a bit about using Codespaces: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUHuEXTne6Q>

After you've done some work and followed the git steps to **synch (or **push**) your files, you'll see them appear in your repository.
