# Numpy and arrays

It is time for our first Python library! **Chapter 4** of our text covers the [numpy](https://numpy.org)library and `arrays`. Arrays can hold many different values, which you then reference or perform operations on. For example, a **matrix** is a two-dimensional array of numbers. However, arrays themselves can have any number *n* dimensions. 

Why do we need arrays? Math stuff. Linear algebra. They allow us to perform mathematical operations on numbers, like stock prices and returns. Arrays are also necessary for machine learning, image recognition, and anything else that requires computation. In short, you really can't do much with arrays.

You may have already seen [arrays in Exce](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/guidelines-and-examples-of-array-formulas-7d94a64e-3ff3-4686-9372-ecfd5caa57c7)

Check out this [DataCamp tutorial on arrays in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-arrays) for more. 

This set of [notes from W3](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) is also a good resource.


## Chapter Four Highlights

| Topic         | Pages  |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | 
| **Integers vs. floats**. Precision and how computers represent numbers. These are foundational concepts in computer science.                | 62 - 65      | 
| **Booleans**. How computers represent true and false. We see logical operators, such as `>`, `<`, `==` and `!=`. `==` and `=` are not the same thing. | 66 - 69    | 
| **Strings**. How computers represent text. Table 3-1 has a good list of string **methods**. We'll talk more about methods, objects, and functions. Skim the two excursions. **Regex** is an important tool in data work, but we won't get into it now.               | 69 - 70     | 
| **Data Structures**. How computers group together other objects. For example, many stock prices or tickers. We'll use **lists** the most, though **numpy arrays** and **pandas data frames** are going to what we really focus on. These data structures are more primitive, in the sense that they are foundational to Python, but people have created new ones that are more suited for our purposes. Note **zero indexing**, where the first item in a list is 0, not 1. Table 3-2 is useful for things that you can with lists.                | 75 - 84; 76 - 79 are the most important      |
