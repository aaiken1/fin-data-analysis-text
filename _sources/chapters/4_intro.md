# Pandas and data

Chapter 4 discusses how to store our data, indexing, column names, converting `numpy` arrays to `pandas` DataFrames, dates, an and summaring our data, especially **by group**. We'll end with merging and reshaping our data.

DataFrames are the main way that we are going to organize our data. They come from the `pandas` package, which along with `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and a few others, form the core of our Python and finance toolbox.

DataFrames are a `class`. A `class` is like a blueprint. We create a DataFrame `object` from this `class`. The object then comes with certain characteristics and things that we can do to it. We call operations on a object `methods`.

Chapter 4 contains perhaps the most important topics we'll cover.

An [excellent and concise guide](https://www.mit.edu/~amidi/teaching/data-science-tools/study-guide/data-manipulation-with-python/#main-concepts) for data manipulation in `pandas`.

The [official `pandas` guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) is also very helpful.

From [Python Programming for Data Science](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/README.html):
- [Chapter 7](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/chapters/chapter7-pandas.html) introduces `pandas`.
- [Chapter 8](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/chapters/chapter8-wrangling-basics.html) of Python Programming for Data Science is all about `pandas`. 

From [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/):
- [Chapter 5](https://wesmckinney.com/book/pandas-basics.html) also introduces `pandas`.
- [Chapter 7](https://wesmckinney.com/book/data-cleaning.html) discusses data cleaning. 
- [Chapter 10](https://wesmckinney.com/book/data-aggregation.html) discusses aggregation and summarizing our data.

From [Coding for Economists](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/intro.html)
- [Working with Data](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/data-intro.html) has `pandas` examples.
- [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/data-exploratory-analysis.html) has data aggregation and summary examples.

You'll see more about `pandas` in the second DataCamp assignment, **Intermediate Python for Finance**. You'll see dates and times using `datetime`. 

As you can see, this is a lot of material! That's because using `pandas` to import, organize, clean, and summarize our data is about 90% of all analysis work. We could spend the entire semester just working through these chapters. In fact, we have an entire **Data Wrangling** class that essentially does that!
