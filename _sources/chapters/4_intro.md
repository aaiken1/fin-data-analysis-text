# Importing and using data

DataFrames are the main way that we are going to organize our data. They come from the `pandas` package, which along with `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and a few others, form the core of our Python and finance toolbox. 

DataFrames are a `class`. A `class` is like a blueprint. We create a dataframe `object` from this `class`. The object then comes with certain characteristics and things that we can do to it. We call operations on a object `methods`. 

This section begins with Chapter 5 of our text and getting data into Python. We'll look at some stock data as an example. 

You'll see more about `pandas` in the second DataCamp assignment.
