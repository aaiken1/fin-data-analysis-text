    "## Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers think of data, or a **value**, as a **type**. For example, in Python, there are three types of numbers: integers, floats, and complex. A **variable** is a name that refers to a value. Python let's you create any variable name as long as it begins with a letter or an underscore, so no numbers to start. It should also not be what is called a r[eserved word](https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) in Python such as `for`, `while`, or `class`. All programming languages have special, reserved words that they don't want us using as variable names. It would get confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common metaphor is to think of a variable as a box that holds some information (like a number, a vector, or a string). We use the **assignment operator** `=` to assign a value to a variable."

This is where `if`, `elif`, and `else` come in. You've probably used something like this in Excel.\n",

You can create [a loop using `for`](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/for-loop-python) that will run the code included in the loop only for values contained in a list. There are also [`while` loops](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/loops-python-tutorial), where the loop will run until a certain criteria, specified by the code, is met. There are subtle differences between the two. `While` loops need to check boolean conditions to see if a condition is `True` or `False` in order to keep going. `For` loops go until the end range is reached. This makes `for` loops faster than `while` loops -- the Python compiler doesn't have to work as hard. \n",
