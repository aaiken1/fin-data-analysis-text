When you create your histogram include this as an argument: `range = (0, 8000000)`. This will have the x-axis go from 0 to 8,000,000, essentially the range of prices that you should have see above.\n",

This will filter your data to only homes with prices less than 1,000,000 and then pass that filtered data set to the `plot()` function. Edit the range and bins to something more appropriate. **Do you see spikes in the data? What's going on there?**\n",
