# Python set-up <a id='python_set-up'></a>

This chapter is going to get you set-up with the Anaconda distribution of Python, Jupyter notebooks, and VS Code. From VS Code, we can also use Jupyter notebooks. I would encourage you to get very comfortable with the Jupyter notebook format and VS Code. We'll go over everything in class as well.

You can start with this video of me discussing [how to download Anaconda and VS Code](https://youtu.be/-3TjSYaYuQY).

You can read more about Python and its history in [Chapter 1 of Python for Data Analysis, 3E](https://wesmckinney.com/book/preliminaries.html). [Chapter 2 discusses Python basics](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-basics.html), like Jupyter notebooks, in detail.

Getting started in Python isn't easy. Even if you're coming from another programming background, like Java, or a statistical language, like R. Data scientist (and [good Twitter follow](https://twitter.com/vboykis)) Vicki Boykis has written about why [getting started in Python can be hard](https://vickiboykis.com/2018/03/12/its-still-hard-for-beginners-to-get-started-with-python/).

Don't get discouraged!

## Other tools

This course is focused on using Python (and the VS Code IDE, Markdown, etc.) to solve financial problems. However, if you're interested in building a full set of data/analytics tools, you need to know more.

This article, also by Vicki Boykis, outlines the need to learn three additional tools: [Git, SQL, and the command line](https://vickiboykis.com/2022/01/09/git-sql-cli/). I use all three in my day-to-day work, though I'm far from an expert in any of them.

Our notes touch on SQL, which is the standard database query language.
