# Python set-up <a id='python_set-up'></a>

This chapter is going to get you set-up with the Anaconda distribution of Python, Jupyter notebooks, and VS Code. From VS Code, we can also use Jupyter notebooks. I would encourage you to get very comfortable with the Jupyter notebook format and VS Code. We'll go over everything in class as well.
