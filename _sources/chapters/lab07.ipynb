    "In this lab, we are going to use the price of four ETFs to find returns and the weights for both an optimal Sharpe and a minimum variance portfolio. Then, we'll calculate non-parametric VaR and CVaR measures for both portfolios and compare. Finally, you download some ETF data and run a factor model regression. You can think of this as part of risk management too - what risks are you exposed to with the ETF that you choose?\n",
