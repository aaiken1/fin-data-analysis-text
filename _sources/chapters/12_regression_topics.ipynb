    "# Regression topics\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will go into more detail on running regressions in Python. We already saw an example using [factor models](10_factor_models.html#factor_models), like the CAPM and Fama-French 3-factor models. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could spend an entire semester going over linear regression, how to put together models, how to interpret models, and all of the adjustments that we can make. In fact, this is basically what a first-semester Econometrics class is!\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is divided into two parts. I start by following code examples from [Coding for Economists](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/econmt-regression.html), which has just about everything you need to know to do basic linear regression (OLS) in Python. This gets us our first look at a linear model and some output.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then turn to **machine learning** and **Chapters 3 and 10 from our Hull textbook**. These chapters also focus on linear regression and how to interpret these types of model. However, we'll also see some newer regression topics from the machine learning perspective, such as **regularization, Ridge regression, and LASSO regression**.  They also discuss logit models, something that we get into in the next set of notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "[The Effect](https://theeffectbook.net) is a great book for getting starting with econometrics, regression, and how to add meaning to the regressions that we're running. [Chapter 13](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-StatisticalAdjustment.html) of that book covers regression (with code in R). Like most econometrics, that book is focused on **causality** - did some intervention or change **cause** a change in behavior or another outcome? These tools are beyond the scope of this course, but we have a new course on Causal Inference if you're interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also see categorical variables and logs. Thinking about how to define our variables is an example of **feature engineering** in the machine learning world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning and the Machine Learning Process. Hull, Chapter 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 1 of Hull starts us the Hull book starts our discussion of machine learning. Tradtional econometrics is about **explaining**. Machine learning is about **predicting**. Roughly speaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw **unsupervised learning** when looking at clustering. Regression gets us into **supervised learning**. From Hull, Chapter 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Supervised learning is concerned with using data to make **predictions**. In the next section, we will show how a simple regression model can be used to predict salaries. This is an example of supervised learning. In Chapter 3, we will consider how a similar model can be used to  predict house prices. We can distinguish between supervised learning models used to predict a variable that can take a continuum of values (such as an individual’s salary or the price of a house) and supervised learning models that are used for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data for supervised learning contains what are referred to as  features and labels. The labels are the values of the target (e.g., the value  of a house or whether a particular loan was repaid). The features are  the variables from which the predictions about the target are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction means that we're going to approach things a bit differently. In particular, we are going to think carefully about **in-sample** vs. **out-of-sample** prediction. From Hull, Chapter 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "> When a data set is used for forecasting or determining a decision strategy, there is a danger that the machine learning model will work well for the data set but will not generalize well to other data. As statisticians have realized for a long time, it is important to test a model out-of-sample. By this we mean that the model should be tested on data that is different from the data used to determine the parameters of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our process is going to have us **fit** a model using **training** data. We might use some **validation** data to **fine-tune** the model. Finally, we **evaluate** the model using our **testing** data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## statsmodel vs. sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "I run linear regressions (OLS) two ways below. I first use `statsmodels`. This method and output looks like \"traditional\" regression analysis. You specify the y-variable, the x-variables you want to include, and get a nice table with output. Very much like what you'd get using Excel and the Data Analysis Toolkit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Hull textbook uses `sklearn`. This library is focused on **machine learning**. The set-up is going to look a lot different. This library will help you process your data, define features, and split it up into training and test data sets. Crucially, you'll want to end up with **X** and **y** data frames that contain **features** and **target** values that you are trying to predict, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two libraries, two ways to do regression. The Hull textbook uses `sklearn` for the **ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net** models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about [the statsmodels library on their help page](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/regression.html). Here's [linear regression from the sklearn libary](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the data that we're using in these examples is already clean. There are no missing values. The columns are what we want. The features and target have been standardized. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, things don't work that way. You need to **carefully look at your data**. The regressions, the models, the machine learning is \"easy\", in a sense. The tools are built-in. You don't exactly have to do a lot of linear algebra or optimization math by hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The real work is in the details. It is your judgement and domain expertise that tells you what features you should be looking for. You need to know how your data were collected. You need the background knowledge to understand your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll spend a lot of time cleaning and organizing your data in our labs and exams. In general, your workflow is going to be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Import your data**. Is it a CSV or Excel file? Is it what you want? Do you need to remove any extra columns? Skip rows? \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Keep the columns that your want.** What's your target, the thing you predicting? What features do you want to include?\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Feature engineering time!** Any missing values? Anything to clean? Check all of you columns. Are some text that you want numeric? Everything we're doing here, for now, is with numeric values. Do you need to create new variables from existing ones? Combine variables into a new feature? Do you want to create dummy variables for categorical features? **You'll spend most of your time doing this.**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Split your data.** Once your data is clean, you can split it into **training** and **testing** samples. Hull will also sometimes split things into an intermediate **validation** sample. Most of your data will be in the training sample. You'll hold out maybe 20% of your data for testing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Standardize your data.** Turn the actual numerical values for your targets and features into z-scores. A general recommendation is to standardize your training data and then use the means and standard deviations from your training data to standardize your testing data. More on this below. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Hull often provides data that is already cleaned, split, and standardized. But, we need to know how to do this. He mentions in the text that he standardizes the testing data using the means and standard deviations from the training data. But, we don't see this when using data that is already cleaned up.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Train your model.** Use your training data to fit your model. Use a validation data set or something like cross-fold validation to look for the optimal hyperparameter(s), if needed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Predict your target.** Take the fitted model that uses the optimal hyperparamter(s) and use it to fit your testing data. Get predicted values and compare to the actual y targets in your testing sample.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Evaluate your model.** How good a job did it do? See Hull for more on the numbers you might use to evaluate a model. I like to make a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values. \n"

By converting categorical variables into this dummy or one-hot encoded format, the machine learning model can better understand and incorporate the information from those categorical variables.\n",

    "In machine learning, data is typically split into three subsets: training data, validation data, and test data. Each subset serves a different purpose in the model development and evaluation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Data**: The training data is the largest portion of the dataset, and it is used to train the machine learning model. During the training process, the model learns patterns and relationships from the training data. The model's parameters are adjusted to minimize the error or loss function on this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation Data**: The validation data is a subset of the data held out from the training process. It is used to evaluate the performance of the model during the training phase. The validation data provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. It helps tune the **hyperparameters** of the model, such as the learning rate, regularization strength, or the number of iterations. The validation data is used to prevent **overfitting**, which occurs when the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. By monitoring the performance on the validation data, early stopping or regularization techniques can be applied to improve the model's generalization capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Data**: The test data is a separate subset of the data that is completely isolated from the training and validation processes. It is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model on unseen data, providing an unbiased estimate of the model's real-world performance. The test data should be representative of the data the model will encounter in production or real-world scenarios. The performance metrics calculated on the test data, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, are considered the final, reliable indicators of the model's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to keep the test data separate and untouched during the training and validation phases to avoid any data leakage or overfitting to the test data. The test data should only be used once, after the model has been fully trained and tuned, to obtain an unbiased estimate of its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By splitting the data into these three subsets, machine learning practitioners can train models effectively, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate the final performance objectively, ensuring that the model will generalize well to new, unseen data.\n",

    "Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + \\cdots + b_m X_m + \\varepsilon\n",

    "\n",
    "The [statsmodel](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/ols.html) page for linear regression has helpful code examples, including how to generate dummy variables (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important regression statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "What is regression trying to do? Hull discusses these linear models from the machine learning perspective. So, rather than a discussion of the [Gauss-Markov theorem and BLUE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss–Markov_theorem), we get something less theoretical. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the linear regression algorithm selects values for $a$ and each $b$ above that minimize the sum of the squared differences between each Y and its predicted value (i.e. the right-hand side of the equation). This is shown in Eq. 3.2. Why do we square the differences? The direction of the error doesn't matter - we want predicted values to be close to the actual value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The text notes that $a$ is called the model **bias** and the $b$ values are called the model **weights**. In econometrics, we call $a$ the **intercept** and the $b$ values **coefficients**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning techniques are all about **prediction**. How well does the model predict or fit the data? To measure this, we can use the **R-Squared** value for the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also put this into words:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Variance of the errors } \\epsilon}{\\text{Variation of the observations on the target Y}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted by the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The R-squared statistic is between zero and one and measures the proportion of the variance in the target that is explained by the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a statistics for the entire model. We also care about how well each feature (variable) does in explaining the variation in our outcome/target/Y variable. We use *t*-statistics for that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, from the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The *t*-statistic of the $a$ or $𝑏_𝑗$ parameters estimated by a linear regression is the value of the parameter divided by its standard error. The P-value is the probability of obtaining a *t*-statistic as large as the one observed if we were in the situation where the parameter had no explanatory power at all. A P-value of 5% or less is generally considered as indicating that the parameter is significant. If the P-value for the parameter $b_j$ in equation (3.1) is less than 5%, we are over 95% confident that the feature $X_j$ has some effect on Y. The critical t-statistic for 95% confidence when the data set is large is 1.96 (i.e., t-statistics greater than  1.96 are significant in the sense that they give rise to P-values less than 5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "I would take issue with some of the language in that explanation. These values are about relationships and correlations, but I see *effect* in that description. Saying that these correlations are actually causal relationships requires assumptions that go beyond pure statistics. You need a model. In our case, this would mean an economic model that describes incentives and behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical features, again\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw these above, when we used *bedroomcnt*. From the Hull text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A common practice is to use the same number of dummy variables as there are categories and associate each dummy variable with a particular category. The value of a dummy variable is one if the corresponding category applies and zero otherwise. This is referred to as **one-hot encoding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used `pd.get_dummies` above to one-hot encode some indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text also discusses the **dummy variable trap**. If you create a dummy variable for each categorical value and then add a constant to the regression model, your model is **overfit** and will not estimate. In economics, we usually include a constant or intercept term in our regressions. This isn't always the case in machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this trap, **drop one of the indicators for the set**. So, suppose that you've taken a variable called *Color* that gets your three indicators for *Color_Red*, *Color_Green*, or \n",
    "*Color_Blue*. **Every** observation has a 1 in one of those columns and zeroes in the others. Drop one of the indicators, like *Color_Red* - remove the column from your data frame. Your model will now run.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, the *Color_Red* observations are those where *Color_Green* and *Color_Blue* are both zero. *Color_Green* and *Color_Blue* are estimated relative to *Color_Red*. For example, if the coefficient for *Color_Green* is 0.5, the the y-variable is shifted by 0.5 when *Color_Green* is equal to one, relative to the default prediction for the *Color_Red*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, though, in machine learning, we often don't spend a lot of time interpreting the coefficients like this. Instead, we want to include as much information as possible in order to make a prediction. Get your model to run and focus on the predicted y variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization and Ridge regression\n",
    "\n",
    "These next three methods come from the machine learning literature and help to deal with having **too many explanatory variables**. When I say this, I mean that they come more from the computer science and statistics world than the econometrics world. This distinction is meaningful if you're trained in one set of methods vs. another, but is becoming less important over time as machine learning and econometrics borrow from each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin} What is econometrics?\n",
    "Econometrics is usually interested in causal relationships among economic agents. So, does more schooling increase wages, or do the people who are good at school also earn more? These are difficult questions to answer and economists have developed a variety of tools to help. If you've taken econometrics, then you've seen topics like instrumental variables and difference-in-differences. In economics, we're more interested in explaining why something is happening than predicting an outcome. So, did a change in a zoning law affect housing prices, rather than predicting a pricing error. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are too many explanatory (X) variables a problem? They make the math harder when different X variables are correlated with one another. In other words, we have different features in our data that are really explaining the same thing. The book uses the area of the basement and the area of the first floor of a house as an example. These values are different, but capture the same thing, generally speaking - house size. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization** helps use reduce the number of variables used in our model. We are also going to see more **scaling** of features. It is important to scale (e.g. Z-score) in order for different features to be comparable with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "A larger, positive z-score means that the observation is above the mean value for that feature (X) or target (y). Vice-versa for negative values. Values are centered around zero after scaling this way. As Hull notes, there are other ways to scale variables, but this Z-score method is very common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [sklearn article](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_scaling_importance.html) on the importance of scaling your features before using them in a machine learning model. From the article:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Feature scaling through standardization, also called Z-score normalization, is an important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms. It involves rescaling each feature such that it has a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to regularize our model is to use a **Ridge regression**. This algorithm chooses $a$ and $b$ parameters to minimize this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - a - b_1X_{i1} - b_2X_{i2} - \\cdots - b_mX_{im})^2 + \\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_j^2\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this looks a lot like a normal regression, except that we now have the last term with $\\lambda$ and $b^2$. From the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> This change has the effect of encouraging the model to keep the weights $b_j$ as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is also called **L2 regularization**. Why do we do this? From the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> L2 regularization is one way of avoiding the situation such as that in equation (3.3) where there are two correlated features, one with a large positive weight and the other with a large negative weight. Its general effect is to **simplify a linear regression model**. Sometimes, the model obtained after regularization generalizes better than the model before regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we choose a value for $\\lambda$? From the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The parameter $\\lambda$ is referred to as a **hyperparameter** because it is used as a tool to determine the best model but is not part of the model itself. The choice of a value for $\\lambda$ is obviously important. A large value for λ would lead to all the $b_j$ being set equal to zero. (The resulting model would then be uninteresting as it would always predict a value equal to $a$ for Y.) In practice, it is desirable to try several different values for $\\lambda$ and choose between the resulting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\lambda$ is set to zero, then we have linear regression. As you increase $\\lambda$, the model will become **less complex**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at **footnote 3**. `sklearn` uses the **sum of squared errors** rather than the **mean sum of squared errors**. In other words, there's no $\\frac{1}{n}$ out in front of the Ridge regression formula. So, you have to multiple your lambda term by $n$, or the number of observations, when using it. See more below, where I work the example in the Hull text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LASSO regression\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Hull text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Ridge, we added a constant times the sum of the squared weights to the objective function. In LASSO, we add a constant times the sum of the **absolute weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "LASSO is also called **L1 regularization**. This changes the last term in the equation that we are trying to minimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - a - b_1X_{i1} - b_2X_{i2} - \\cdots - b_mX_{im})^2 + \\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^{m}|b_j|\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked the Claude GPT to explain this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation represents the objective function for LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. LASSO is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization to add a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term encourages sparse solutions, driving some coefficient estimates to exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection and improving interpretability of the model. The first term is the regular least squares error term that measures the model's fit to the data. The second term is the L1 regularization penalty on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients ($|b_j|$), multiplied by a tuning parameter lambda that controls the strength of the penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "By minimizing this objective function, LASSO regression aims to find the best fit linear model while also promoting sparsity in the coefficients, making it useful for scenarios with many potential predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LASSO is going to mean having more $b = 0$ values. In other words, some features are \"kicked out of the model\" in order to simplify things. This is going to happen when **certain features explain the same variation in the Y variable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, check out footnote 4 for some details on how lASSO works in `sklearn`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elastic net regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net regression is a **mixture of Ridge and LASSO**. The function to be minimized includes both a constant times the sum of the squared weights and a different constant times the sum of the absolute values of the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - a - b_1X_{i1} - b_2X_{i2} - \\cdots - b_mX_{im})^2 + \\lambda_1\\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_j^2 + \\lambda_2\\sum_{j=1}^{m}|b_j|\n",

    "\n",
    "From the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In LASSO some weights are set to zero, but others may be quite large in magnitude. In Ridge, weights are small in magnitude, but they are not reduced to zero. The idea underlying Elastic Net is that we may be able to get the **best of both worlds** by making some weights zero while reducing the magnitude of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Claude:\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation represents the objective function for Elastic Net regularization, which is a linear regression model that combines the L1 (LASSO) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques. The first term is the standard mean squared error term, which measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual target values ($Y_i$) for the given data points ($X_{i1}$, $X_{i2}$, ..., $X_{im}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second term is the L2 regularization penalty, also known as the Ridge penalty, which adds the sum of the squared coefficients ($b_j^2$) multiplied by a tuning parameter $λ_1$. This penalty encourages small coefficient values and helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third term is the L1 regularization penalty, also known as the LASSO penalty, which adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients ($|b_j|$) multiplied by a tuning parameter $λ_2$. This penalty promotes sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the L1 and L2 penalties, Elastic Net regularization aims to benefit from the strengths of both Ridge and LASSO regularization. It can handle correlated predictors better than LASSO and can select more predictive features than Ridge regression. The tuning parameters $λ_1$ and $λ_2$ control the relative importance of the L1 and L2 penalties, respectively. Elastic Net regularization is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data with potentially correlated predictors, where both variable selection and coefficient shrinkage are desirable.\n",

When alpha=0, there is no regularization, and the model becomes a ordinary least squares linear regression.\n",

Specifically: l1_ratio=1 means the penalty is an L1 penalty (Lasso). l1_ratio=0 means the penalty is an L2 penalty (Ridge). 0 < l1_ratio < 1 means the penalty is a combination of L1 and L2 penalties (Elastic Net).\n",

In practice, you would tune both alpha and l1_ratio using cross-validation to find the best combination for your specific data. Common values for l1_ratio are 0.5 (balanced Elastic Net), 0.2, or 0.8 depending on whether you want more L2 or L1 regularization respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model and tune its hyperparameters. It helps to estimate how well the model will generalize to unseen data, and it is particularly useful when the available data is limited. The main idea behind cross-validation is to split the dataset into two parts: a training set and a validation set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set. This process is repeated multiple times, with different portions of the data being used for training and validation in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are several types of cross-validation techniques, but the most common is **k-fold cross-validation**. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dataset is randomly partitioned into k equal-sized subsets or \"folds\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One of the k folds is held out as the validation set, and the remaining k-1 folds are used for training the model. The model is trained on the k-1 folds and evaluated on the held-out validation fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This process is repeated k times, with each of the k folds being used as the validation set exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, mean squared error) is calculated for each iteration, and the final performance is the average of the k iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cross-validation has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provides a more reliable and unbiased estimate of the model's performance compared to a single train-test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It helps to prevent overfitting by evaluating the model on data that it has not seen during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It allows for effective hyperparameter tuning by selecting the hyperparameters that yield the best average performance across the cross-validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It makes efficient use of the available data by using every data point for both training and validation at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross-validation is widely used in machine learning competitions, research, and real-world applications. It is a crucial technique for evaluating and tuning models, especially when dealing with limited data or when it is important to estimate the model's generalization performance accurately.\n",

    "  \n",
    "- I'm asking for the [aic criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion). This is a measure of best fit. I will also ask for the [bic criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion), another measure of best fit. The smaller the value, the better the model fits the data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `LassoLarsIC` tells the code to run the lasso model, which we then fit on our training data. This function is going to pick a bunch of alpha values for us, fit the model, and report the requested criterion back to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a description of `make_pipeline` from Claude GPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `make_pipeline` is a utility function provided by scikit-learn that creates a Pipeline object, which is a sequence of transformers and an estimator. It is a convenient way to chain multiple estimators into a single unit. The make_pipeline function takes any number of estimators as arguments and returns a Pipeline object. The estimators are applied in the order they are passed to the function. The last estimator is always a classifier or regressor, while the other estimators are transformers (preprocessors).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some key features and benefits of using make_pipeline are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convenience**: It provides a simple and readable way to define a sequence of estimators, making the code more concise and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated Data Flow**: The Pipeline object automatically applies the transformers to the input data and passes the transformed data to the final estimator. This avoids the need to manually handle the data flow between estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: All estimators in the pipeline, except the last one, must be transformers (i.e., have a transform method). This consistency makes it easier to understand and reason about the data flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistence**: The entire pipeline can be persisted to disk using the joblib module, making it easy to reuse the same preprocessing and modeling steps in different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallelization**: Some transformers in the pipeline can be parallelized using the n_jobs parameter, potentially leading to faster processing times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation**: The entire pipeline can be used in cross-validation loops, ensuring that the same preprocessing steps are applied to both the training and validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, make_pipeline simplifies the process of chaining multiple estimators together and helps to create more readable, maintainable, and efficient code for machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's my `make_pipeline`. I am fitting a LASSO model, where I have it use the AIC criteria to pick the \"best\" hyperparameter. It then fit the model using our new combined training data.\n",

    "- LassoCV: This is the class name for the Lasso regression model with built-in cross-validation for automatically tuning the regularization strength parameter (alpha).\n",
    "\n",
    "- cv=20: This is a parameter that specifies the number of folds for cross-validation. In this case, it means that the cross-validation process will be repeated 20 times, each time using a different 1/20th of the data as the validation set and the remaining 19/20ths as the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The LassoCV class performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It splits the data into cv (20 in this case) folds or subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "2a. It holds out that fold as the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2b. It trains the Lasso regression model on the remaining cv-1 folds, using a range of different alpha values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2c. It evaluates the performance of the model on the held-out validation fold for each alpha value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After all folds have been processed, it selects the alpha value that gives the best average performance across all folds.\n",
    "\n",

    "By using cross-validation, LassoCV can automatically find the optimal value of the regularization parameter (alpha) that balances the trade-off between model complexity and goodness of fit. This helps to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. The choice of cv = 20 is a common practice, as it provides a good balance between computational cost and reliable estimation of the model's performance. However, the optimal value of cv can depend on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem.\n",

If the value of feature $j$ increases by an amount $u$ with all other features remaining the same, the value of the target increases by $b_{j,u}$. In the case of categorical features that are 1 or 0, the  weight gives the impact on a prediction of the target of changing the  category of the feature when all other features are kept the same. \n",
