# CompSci 101: Types, control, and numpy arrays

This is where we start with some computer science basics. Essentially, where every coding class begins. We'll discuss **data types** and **data structures**, such as the differences between integers and floats, booleans (i.e. True or False), a bit about strings (text), and lists. 

We'll then get into more Python-specific material and introduce the crucial [numpy](https://numpy.org) package. This package will allow us to use **arrays** in Python. Arrays are a way to store things, like numbers, in Python.

`Numpy` arrays allow us to do a lot of different math, like linear algebra, in Python and are much faster than the Python list data type.

I also mention **functional programming** (something we'll come back to) and **control structures**, like `if` and `else` statements.

These notes follow along with Chapters 3 and 4 of [Python for Finance, 2e](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-finance/9781492024323/).

Finally, you'll see this material again in your first Datacamp assignment, **Introduction to Python for Finance**. Control structures will appear in your second assignment, **Intermediate Python for Finance**.
