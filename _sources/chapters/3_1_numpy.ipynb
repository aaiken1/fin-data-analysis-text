    "# Numpy and arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time for our first Python library! **Chapter 4** of our text covers the [numpy](https://numpy.org) library and `arrays`. Arrays can hold many different values, which you then reference or perform operations on. For example, a **matrix** is a two-dimensional array of numbers. However, arrays themselves can have any number *n* dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need arrays? Math stuff. Linear algebra. They allow us to perform mathematical operations on numbers, like stock prices and returns. Arrays are also necessary for machine learning, image recognition, and anything else that requires computation. In short, you really can't do much with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have already seen [arrays in Exce](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/guidelines-and-examples-of-array-formulas-7d94a64e-3ff3-4686-9372-ecfd5caa57c7)\n",
