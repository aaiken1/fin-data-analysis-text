    "## Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers think of data, or a **value**, as a **type**. For example, in Python, there are three types of numbers: integers, floats, and complex. A **variable** is a name that refers to a value. Python let's you create any variable name as long as it begins with a letter or an underscore, so no numbers to start. It should also not be what is called a r[eserved word](https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) in Python such as `for`, `while`, or `class`. All programming languages have special, reserved words that they don't want us using as variable names. It would get confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common metaphor is to think of a variable as a box that holds some information (like a number, a vector, or a string). We use the **assignment operator** `=` to assign a value to a variable."
