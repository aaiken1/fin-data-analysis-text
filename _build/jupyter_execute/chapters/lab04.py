# # Lab 04
# ## Stock Stuff
# 
# In this lab, we are going to look at ETF and stock returns. This means dealing with **financial time series**. For now, our data will be organized a certain way. Each column will represent an asset and a characteristics of that asset, like a price or return. The index will be a date of some kind. This could mean daily, weekly, monthly, etc.
# 
# Use our online notes to complete our labs. I have my own commentary and links that will help. You can work through the parts below in order.
# 
# If you are getting errors and are not sure why, my first suggestion is always to **Restart** the Python kernel, to **Clear All Output**, and run each code cell **one-by-one** from the top.
# 
# Let each code cell represent one idea, or output. Take advantage of **Markdown** in your write-up. Use headers and formatting. Here's a [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) that I keep handy. Once you figure out some of the basics, you might not want to go back to Word or Google Docs. 
# 
# Finally, use **Chapter 8** of our textbook as a resource. I have that chapter and our online notes open as I'm making this lab. I will refer to page numbers. I may also ask you to do figure out how to do something that isn't exactly in our notes!
# 

# ## Part 1
# 
# Open up VS Code. Have you set up your class folder yet? I've posted a video that will help you figure that part out. Open up that folder under File. You should see it in the **EXPLORER** window pane on the left. 
# 
# Type **Cmd-Shift-P** (Ctrl-Shift-P in Windows) to open up the command palette. Make sure there's a little `>` in the search bar that pops up (there should be). Search for `Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook`. This will open up a blank `.ipynb` file. Save this in a new folder in your course folder called `lab03`. Call this file `lab04-lastname-firstname`, where you fill in your name, of course!
