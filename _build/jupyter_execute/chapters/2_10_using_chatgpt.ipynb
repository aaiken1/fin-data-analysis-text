    "# Using ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "There are now many AI-based tools to help us code. These tools can create code outlines for us, check our own code, write functions, and explain the steps. I'm going to show you a few examples using the free [OpenAI ChapGPT tools](https://chat.openai.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Github and VS Code, you can sign-up for [CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/). \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper by [Liu, Miller, and Niu (2023)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4412371) has some great examples of how to use ChatGPT in a course like this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There's a trade-off when using AI code assists. They will make you faster and check your syntax. They work well for simple tasks in a introductory course like this. But, at some point, you want to understand the code. You'll need to tweak it to get it to work. And, if you're doing more interesting coding, they may be of limited use. So - use them, but with these caveats in mind!\n",

    "## Using GPT to Write a Function For You\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go to Chapter 7, where I show you how to write a function to generate asset paths using **geometric brownian motion**. We use the Nasdaq API to bring in some bitcoin data in that example. Now, I'm going to use ChatGPT to write the same function. I gave GPT4 the following prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Write a function in Python that simulates geometric brownian motion for any number of assets. Create the appropriate inputs as arrays. The inputs should be the number of assets, the mean for each asset, the standard deviation for each asset, the number of periods, the initial value of each asset, and the number of simulations. The output should be an array that contains all of the simulations for each asset. These are uncorrelated assets, so don't worry about covariance.\n",
