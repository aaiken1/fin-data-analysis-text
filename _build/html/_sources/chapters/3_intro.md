# CompSci 101: Types, control, and numpy arrays

These notes follow along with Chapters 3 and 4 of our textbook. In Chapter 3, we discuss **data types** and **data structures**, such as the differences between integers and floats, booleans (i.e. True or False), a bit about strings (text), and lists. Chapter 4 introduces the crucial [numpy](https://numpy.org) library. This library will allow us to use **arrays** in Python. Numpy arrays allow us to do a lot of different math, like linear algebra, in Python and are much faster than the Python list data type.

```{note}
 As we go through out textbook, I highlight what I think are the most important concepts and note the page numbers.

There are also mentions of **functional programming** (something we'll come back to) and **control structures**, like `if` and `else` statements.

 My notes here combine examples from our text, with other resources and my own commentary. I let you know where all of the material is coming from.

 Finally, you'll see this material again in your first Datacamp assignment, **Introduction to Python for Finance**. Control structures will appear in your second assignment, **Intermediate Python for Finance**.
