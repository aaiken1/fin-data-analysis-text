    "| **Data Structures**. How computers group together other objects. For example, many stock prices or tickers. We'll use **lists** the most, though **numpy arrays** and **pandas data frames** are going to what we really focus on. These data structures are more primitive, in the sense that they are foundational to Python, but people have created new ones that are more suited for our purposes. Note **zero indexing**, where the first item in a list is 0, not 1. Table 3-2 is useful for things that you can with lists.                | 75 - 84; 76 - 79 are the most important      | \n",

    "## Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers think of data, or a **value**, as a **type**. For example, in Python, there are three types of numbers: integers, floats, and complex. A **variable** is a name that refers to a value. Python let's you create any variable name as long as it begins with a letter or an underscore, so no numbers to start. It should also not be what is called a r[eserved word](https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) in Python such as `for`, `while`, or `class`. All programming languages have special, reserved words that they don't want us using as variable names. It would get confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common metaphor is to think of a variable as a box that holds some information (like a number, a vector, or a string). We use the **assignment operator** `=` to assign a value to a variable."
