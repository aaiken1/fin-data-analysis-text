# Python set-up <a id='python_set-up'></a>

This chapter is going to get you set-up with the Anaconda distribution of Python, Jupyter notebooks, and VS Code. From VS Code, we can also use Jupyter notebooks. I would encourage you to get very comfortable with the Jupyter notebook format and VS Code. We'll go over everything in class as well.

You can start with this video of me discussing [how to download Anaconda and VS Code](https://youtu.be/-3TjSYaYuQY).

You can read more about Python and its history in [Chapter 1 of Python for Data Analysis, 3E](https://wesmckinney.com/book/preliminaries.html). [Chapter 2 discusses Python basics](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-basics.html), like Jupyter notebooks, in detail.
