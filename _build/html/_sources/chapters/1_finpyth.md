# Why python and finance?

## How is python used in finance?


## Our textbook and these notes.

Our book covers a wide range of topics in finance.

Chapters 1 and 2 Python, why it is used in finance, and a lot of terms and concepts that we aren't really going to be getting into. For example, we are definitely not going to be creating Ubuntu and Python Docker images. This 

The most important part is to make sure that you are up and running with Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, and VS Code. The next chapter will discuss this. 

Our textbook goes into more detail in many cases than we are going to have time for. 

## Other Resources

[Coding for Economists](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/intro.html) is an excellent online book that discusses getting Python set up, importing and exploring your data, as well as more advanced econometrics topics that we won't get into here. But, if you're using STATA in another class, I recommend taking a look at what you can do for free in Python. You might not have that STATA license on the job!
